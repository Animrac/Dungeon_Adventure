Time spent: 12 hours

Shortcomings:
-Majority of my time was spent trying to fix my previous Heroes vs Monsters assignment. I finally got it to compile and work with a tester main, but when I added in user input I couldn’t get past entering in a selection for a hero. The program just stopped and didn’t continue with the rest of the code.

-My room and dungeon class are a mess because they were difficult to test without my basic HeroesVsMonsters game working.

Problems:
-In Hunter class had problems with creating sneak attack special skill.
-When testing entire program in HeroesVersusMonsters class using the code
	from class, kept getting IllegalArgumentException for checkMinVersusMax
	and setMinSpecialDamage. This is where I got stuck with writing the driver class.
